# Instructions

- After you're done making changes to the code, always run `pnpm lint` to verify there are no type errors. If there are, fix all of them until there are none left.
- Always follow good software engineering principles e.g. preventing duplicate code
- Lean more towards interfaces and functions instead of classes
