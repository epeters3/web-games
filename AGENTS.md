# Instructions

- After you're done making changes to the code, always run `pnpm lint` to verify
  there are no type errors. If there are, fix all of them until there are none
  left.
- Always follow good software engineering principles e.g. preventing duplicate
  code
- Lean more towards interfaces and functions instead of classes
- Any time you learn a key insight that will be good to remember for later,
  always add it to the relavant folder's AGENTS.md file, so future versions of
  yourself don't have to re-learn what you did. Don't treat AGENTS.md like a
  changelog. Instead, it is a living document that reflects the background
  context and current state of the design guidelines and notes.
- Before implementing something complicated, always first ask: does one of the
  frameworks in this project already have a simple native way of doing this?
